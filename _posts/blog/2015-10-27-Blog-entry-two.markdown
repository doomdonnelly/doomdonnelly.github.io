    Doomy Donnelly
</p>
<p>
    His tongue ties in knots
</p>
<p>
    He screws up his words
</p>
<p>
    He can’t always say what he wants me to hear
</p>
<p>
    But deep in those eyes
</p>
<p>
    I see what he means
</p>
<p>
    And I see forever when I can see clear
</p>
<p>
    <em>I told you once</em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>That all I could see</em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>When I looked deep in your eyes were galaxies</em>
</p>
<p>
    I’m not always there
</p>
<p>
    I’m not always nice
</p>
<p>
    But there’s a piece of me that I leave behind
</p>
<p>
    I don’t say shit like that
</p>
<p>
    I’m not a poet or greeting card
</p>
<p>
    But the words fit, the words fit
</p>
<p>
    Every smile that I get
</p>
<p>
    When eyes follow me
</p>
<p>
    They don’t mean so much with you on my mind
</p>
