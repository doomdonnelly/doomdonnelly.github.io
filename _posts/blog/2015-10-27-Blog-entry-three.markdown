    Get Her Out
</p>
<p align="center">
    (Doomy Donnelly)
</p>
<p>
    Just stop that and look over here
</p>
<p>
    It’s time to yell, to swear, to scream
</p>
<p>
    Don’t smile for me, it’s time to fight
</p>
<p>
    Exorcise those demons and shadows of your night
</p>
<p>
    <em>So get her out, get her out, get her of your head</em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>Tell me now, tell me now, tell me now that you’re mad</em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>She left a nasty mess behind, cursed you to hell and back</em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>You went halfway but you never came back</em>
</p>
<p>
    I fell in love you with before we even met
</p>
<p>
    I saw you laughing at a table and I knew it was my end
</p>
<p>
    But you’re so good at putting on a show
</p>
<p>
    But I need you now and it’s time for her to go
</p>
<p>
    [CHORUS]
</p>
<p>
    It’s not a stage, it’s not a show, it’s not instavideo
</p>
<p>
    She was bitch, she cut you deep, and it’s time for me to know
</p>
<p>
    All the pain, all that burning underneath your skin
</p>
<p>
    Let out the anger and the regrets, make some room and let me in
</p>
<p>
    Noise and tears and rage won’t make me go away
</p>
<p>
    They’re not mine, so I can take one on the chin and say
</p>
<p>
    I know you loved her but she wrecked your life
</p>
<p>
    She may have well just cut up your soul with a knife
</p>
<p>
    [Chorus]
</p>
<p>
    But I refuse to let her keep that part of you forever
</p>
<p>
    You’ve given me a body and I’m a picture of your lover
</p>
<p>
    But you need your heart back and your beautiful light
</p>
<p>
    Not for me but for yourself so start your crying and the fight
</p>
<p>
    [Chorus]
</p>
<p>
    It’s going to be a long few days or weeks to really end this purge
</p>
<p>
    I’ll still be here, cleaning up the dishes and the bottles, all the
    jettison of your surge
</p>
<p>
    If you fall I’ll pick you up and hold you til you stand again
</p>
<p>
    If you want space I’ll go outside, when you need me call me in
</p>
