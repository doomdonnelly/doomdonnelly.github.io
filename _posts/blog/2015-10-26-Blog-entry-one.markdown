“Panhandle”
INT. Hotel Room Day
EMILY, a woman in her late 30s/early 40s, dressed in slacks and a blouse, paces, drink in hand. Her phone buzzes and she looks down at a text that reads “I’m in the lobby.” She texts “Room 427.”
She stares out the window until there’s a knock at the door. PAUL, a man in his mid-fifties, dressed also in business casual, enters and smiles warmly.
				EMILY:
			(Reaching out for a hug)
			Hey stranger. Welcome to lovely St. Louis.
				PAUL:
			Hey beauty.
The two close the door and enter into a passionate kiss.
				PAUL:
			(out of breath)
			Oh I’ve missed you.
				EMILY:
			(Smiling slyly)
			Prove it.
Paul drops his bags, and kisses Emily again, kicking off his shoes and pulling off her clothes as they head towards the bed.

INT. HOTEL - Day
Paul and Emily are naked, intertwined in the white sheets of their bed. Her head is on his chest and he’s stroking her hair.
				EMILY:
			So I guess you really did miss me.
				PAUL:
Mmmmmmmm. Always. That was wonderful. You’re wonderful. Everything is wonderful.
	EMILY:
Yep.
She strokes his chest and lifts her eyes to look into his. They kiss and the intensity grows. She moves on top of him and they make love again. The scene is not graphically sexual, but emphasizes the way they touch each other and the amount of eye contact they maintain, showing a powerfully passionate yet extremely intimate relationship.
(Later)
Emily and Paul are still in bed. Paul is trying to instigate another round of sex but Emily wiggles away from him.
				Emily
				(Smiling)
Not that I don’t appreciate your priorities, but I do have a job to do. And I’m running late already.
	Paul
	(sighs dramatically)
So responsible.
	Emily
It’s true. I’m the pinnacle of reliability.
She stands up and heads into the bathroom. She talks as she’s getting ready.
Are you going with me? You’ll like Jen. She’s hilariously irreverent.
	Paul
(from the bed)
She also found a way to pay your full-rate plus expenses. I like her already.
	Emily
And we’re going to have a lovely comp-ed dinner.
	Paul
I’d rather be comping—
	Emily (cuts him off)
Settle down buddy. We’ll still be back early. Come on. Up and at ‘em. Time to be professionals.
She walks over to the bed, fully dressed and ready to leave then leans down to kiss him. He grabs her and pulls her into bed.  
					Paul
				Alright, responsible party. But kiss
				me first.
				(Pause while they kiss)
				I love you, Em.
					Emily
				I love you too, Paulie.
She kisses him again.

Int- Auditorium- Evening
Emily is on stage at a podium in a medium-sized university auditorium. Applause sounds as she thanks everyone for coming. As people file from their seats, she takes her place at a table on stage and begins signing books. Paul is sitting in the front row, smiling as he talks with Emily’s friend JEN.
				Jen
Look at her up there. All grown up and professional. The Emily I remember was usually buzzed and shoeless.
	Paul
I think she still rejects shoes most of the time. And with her three little ones at home I’m guessing she’d prefer to be buzzed most of the time as well.
	Jen
Gawd yes. They do encourage mild alcoholism. I’ve got a 3-year-old at home.
(pause)
What about you? You have kids?
	Paul
I do. Two boys and a girl. Mine are mostly grown, though—24, 22, and 19. But I remember the toddler days all too clearly.
(He smiles and shakes his head)
So how long have you two known each other?
	Jen
We met our first week of graduate school. We both rolled our eyes at someone stupid and we’ve been friends ever since.
Now we’re grown ups. It boggles the mind we lived through those years.
		Paul
Alas, reality. I still can’t believe I lived through college. And I’m ancient.
		Jen
	(jokingly)
You’re not ancient. I wouldn’t even call you elderly.
		Paul
Flatterer. Stop hitting on a married man!
They’re still laughing as an exhausted Emily calls to them from the stage.
					Emily
Alright, you two. Enough fun. Time to feed the author, Dr. Wright. And her agent. Let’s go have fun now.
Emily walks down the stage stairs, heading over to Jen and Paul who are packing up their stuff.
		Jen
Tonight was great. Thanks for being here, Em. The students loved it. So did the faculty, actually. You got glowing reports.
		Emily
Well thank you for paying for the gig. You know I would’ve come for free.
		Paul
	(with mock seriousness)
Emily, we’ve talked about that…
		Emily
I know, I know. Sorry. What I meant to say was “you guys should have paid me more.” Better Paulie?
		Paul
Perfect.
		Jen
Well, it wasn’t my money. Let’s go drink.

Int-Airport-Day
Emily files off a crowded flight with her carry on, purse, and a small white plastic bag. She hurries through the crowds, passing signs that read “Welcome to the Sunshine State” and “Welcome to Paradise,” casting a glance at couples and friends hugging as they greet each other outside of security. As she passes them her phone buzzes. It’s a text from DEREK that says “haul ass.” She makes a face at her phone.
					Emily (VO)
And welcome home to the warm bosom of my family.
She heads out of baggage claim and finds an agitated Derek waiting in the car.
				Derek
			Jesus, Em. What took you so long?
				Emily
			Seriously? You want to try that one again?
				Derek
Sorry. Welcome home, babe. What the fuck took you so long? I’ve been circling for like 30 minutes.
	Emily
I was on a Gratefully Not Dead flight. It took me that long to deplane. Everyone in front of me was like 90. Sorry to inconvenience you, jackass. I keep telling you I should just park when I fly.
	Derek
That’s such as a waste of money. It’s not a huge deal.
(Pause)
How was the gig? How’s Jen?
	Emily
She’s great. Looks great. I didn’t meet her kid, but she seems to have taken well to motherhood. Didn’t stop us from doing shots last night, though. Ugh.
	Derek
Classy. Wish drunken debauchery was a part of my travel for work.
	Emily
You’re just jealous. Besides. They were paid for by her department. I was obligated.
	Derek
Did Paul come?
	Emily
(Surprised)
Wha-Huh?
	Derek
You said Paul was going to try and make more of the speaking gigs. Plugs for the publishing house or something?
	Emily
Oh yeah. He was there. Took some photos. Went to dinner with us last night.
	Derek
Seems like they could’ve just sent an intern or something.
	Emily
He’s checking on me. It’s nice. He’s a good agent, Derek.
	Derek
He wants to get in your pants.
	Emily (VO)
	Uhhhhhhhh.
	Emily
Just stop.
(beat)
How are the kids? House still standing?
	Derek
Yeah. They’re fine. Functioning quite well with an absentee mother.
	Emily
It was one night. Now I’m back. World order officially restored.
	Derek
Not exactly. Now you’re about to destroy it with the invasion of the James family.
	Emily
(Sarcastically)
Yes! Anniversary party week. Here we go! Woo hoo!
	Derek
You heard about the storm, right?
	Emily
Don’t joke. I’m on the edge already.
	Derek
Actually I’m serious. There’s a storm coming across Mexico. It’s a Tropical Storm now. Tropical Storm Winston.
	Emily
Winston? Oooh. Scary.
			(Pause)
			Is it really coming here?
				Derek
You know what it’s like—20 scenarios. A few have it coming straight here, a few disintegrating over Mexico. A few headed to New Orleans.
	Emily
Shit.
	Derek
It’ll be fine, Em. A little rain’s not going to stop your soiree.
INT-O’Connor House-Day
Emily and Derek are coming in from the airport trip. They drive through a clean, quiet neighborhood with moderately large houses, green lawns, sidewalks, etc. They pull into their drive, their house is a blue, vinyl-sided, Key West style two-story house, large, but not extraordinary, indicating that they are comfortable but not exactly rich.
JAMIE, their babysitter, meets them at the door as all three kids, NATE, 7, and 3-year-old twins MOLLY and FREYA come running. It’s chaos. Derek talks to Jamie and gives her some money while Emily is mauled by the kids.
				Derek
Thanks Jamie. You sure you don’t need a lift?
	Jamie
No thanks, Derek. It’s really only half a block.
Trying to get all three kids’ attention she affectionately says her good-byes. As she exits the garage a chorus us “what’d you bring us mommy” erupts.
				Emily
			Greedy little monsters! Here! Here!
The girls get plastic snow globes and Nate gets a t-shirt.
			Molly, Freya, and Nate
			Thanks mommy!!
They run off. Emily turns to Derek to finish their earlier conversation from the car.
				Emily
It’s just I’d planned for most of the party to be outside. Do you think we’ll have enough room in here?
	Derek
Yeah. I mean there’s the porch, too—it’s covered. And we can clear some of the furniture out of the family room. It’ll be fine, Em. Really.
	Emily
Okay, I guess. Alright. Let me dump my stuff. I’m guessing you all want to be fed.
(sighs)
As usual. Seriously. It’s every night with you people.
What’d you eat last night?
	Derek
Sandwiches.
	Emily
Every time, D? Really? Jesus.
(pause)
Can we just order pizza tonight?
	Derek
Extra meat products on mine, please!
He heads off to watch TV. Emily heads to the bedroom. She flips on the TV to a muted weather channel as she changes into more comfortable clothes. When she sees Florida appear she turns up the volume.
				Weather Guy
Well, it looks like Winston, our unexpected late storm here at the end of Hurricane season, is headed straight for the panhandle. Depending on how much time the storm spends over the Gulf, we could be looking at category 1 or 2 hurricane by Saturday.
	Emily
	(Yelling)
No! No weather guy! No! I refuse to have this party ruined by a storm named Winston. That’s ridiculous. You’re ridiculous! Your hair—it’s ridiculous.
She turns off the TV and throws down the remote then checks her phone. She has a text from Paul that reads “hope you’re safely home. I’m back in the large apple, missing you already. So good to see you. Xo” She sends a quick text back, then calls for pizza.

EXT. Sports Field	Day
Sitting on crowded bleachers with indeterminate noises of kids playing sports around her, Emily looks at the well-pedicured feet of the WOMAN sitting next to her, then looks at her own feet in worn out flip flops with chipped nail polish. Her reverie is interrupted by the woman’s voice and Emily’s head pops up to look at her.
					WOMAN:
			Which one is yours?
					EMILY:
			Mine? Oh—my son. Nate. He’s the goalie.
Both women pause to clap and cheer. The pedicured woman stands up and shakes a pom pom. Emily rolls her eyes.
					Emily (VO)
				Oh. Dear. Lord.
					WOMAN:
Ohhh yes. My Ryan mentioned him. He’s the new boy. Your family just moved here?
		EMILY:
Yes. This past summer.
		WOMAN:
My Ryan says that Nate doesn’t go to Wildwood? Are you, um, Catholic? Does he go to St. Ignatius?
		EMILY:
Oh. No. He goes to Fallingham. The lab school at NFU?
		WOMAN:
(A sickly sweet tinge to her voice)
Oh. I see. Is he, well, I mean, does he have some
(lowers her voice)
special needs?
(Tilts her head to the side like a bird)
	EMILY:
(Tilting her head too)
No, actually he’s quite, uh, um, some of his abilities are above his grade level. At Fallingham we can keep him with his peer group but he’s allowed to take certain classes with other grade levels…
Her voice fades as she notices the woman is no longer paying attention.
				Emily (VO)
				Ach. Fuck ‘er.
By now the woman has tuned out and is shouting encouragement at Ryan. Emily sits back. She sees Nate wave to her from the net and waves back.
Turning her head to the right she sees Molly and Freya happily throwing grass at each other and laughing.
				EMILY (VO)
			Beautiful monsters in training.

The crowd around them cheers and everyone gets up and off the bleachers. Nate comes jogging over.
				EMILY:
			(Hugging Nate)
Well done sweetie! Your Dad’s going to be so happy! Another clean sheet.
NATE:
Aww. The other team didn’t know what they were doing. It was easy.
(Disappointed)
I didn’t even have to dive to save anything.
				EMILY:
Well I think you looked great. Coach TIPTON is certainly excited.
Emily smiles in the direction of an attractive man in his mid 30s, obviously the team’s coach. He begins to walk over. Emily runs her hand through her hair and curls her chipped toenails under self-consciously.
				TIPTON:
Great job Nate!! Second game with no goals! We’re headed to the championship, I can feel it.
(Conspiratorially whispers)
Make your mom get you ice cream, kiddo.
Nate smiles.
				EMILY:
			(Skeptically)
			They have pee wee soccer championships?
				TIPTON:
			(Chuckling softly)
Well, sort of. It’s a Saturday thing where the teams all play and then the kids get ice cream and the teams get medals for different things. Not exactly, uh, cut throat.
Emily smiles at him.
				TIPTON:
So where’s DEREK today? He’s gonna be so proud of his little man here.
	EMILY:
(Rolls eyes)
Oh, poor Derek. He’s being tortured by his ridiculously demanding wife and is at home, working on the house. My family is coming into town this week and Derek wants to get the yard cleaned up. And the garage. And the guest room. And apparently he can’t find a bunch of his tools. He’s worried he left them in Ohio. I think he just hasn’t found the right box yet…
(Realizes she is rambling and trails off)
	TIPTON:
(Smiles and laughs)
I understand. Tell him if he needs anything to call me. We’re still on for dinner tonight, though, right? 7:00?
	Emily:
Yes! We can’t wait to meet your wife. And a night of grown-up conversation sounds delightful.
		Tipton:
Great! We’ll see you at the restaurant.
Annnnd the girls are heading to the parking lot, by the way. Wow (stares) they’re really fast!
Emily and Nate run after the girls as she waves a good bye to Tipton.
				EMILY:
				GIRLS!!

Ext-O’Connor Front Yard-Day
Emily is driving down her street. The kids are snarking at each other in the back seat, the radio is on trying to drown out the chatter and Emily looks in horror at her front yard as she pulls into the driveway. The front yard has been half mowed and the mower sits idle in the middle of the yard. There’re bush clippings everywhere.

			      Emily (VO)
What the hell? I’m going to kill him. I’m going to run him over with his own damn lawn mower.
As she parks and the kids start to pile out of the car, she climbs out slowly assessing the yard.
She finds Derek in the garage in a lawn chair with an almost empty Gatorade container in his grasp. He’s sweaty, dirty, and shirtless. His elbows are on his knees and he’s slumped over, his belly protruding. He looks up as the family comes in.
				Derek
			Hey guys. How’d it go?
				Nate
			A clean sheet Dad! 2 in a row.
				Emily
			He was amazing, D. Quite the hero.
				Derek
			Wish I could’ve seen it, kiddo. Next time!
				Emily
Go wash up, tell your sisters to as well, okay?
	Derek
(woefully)
Oh babe. It’s so fucking hot here. I may die. Right here in the garage. We’ve got to re-hire the yard guy.
	Emily
How much did you get done?
	Derek
Jesus, Em. You’re looking at it. It’s a nightmare.
	Emily
We’ve been gone for almost 3 hours, Derek. And you did half the front yard?!
	Derek
You do it next time! Seriously. Don’t give me shit. You got to drive around in air conditioning and sit on your ass. I’m out here in what feels like the outer portion of Hell trying to mow grass that fights back! And don’t get me started on that hedge. It has thorns or something. And there was a snake. A big one. A SNAKE, Emily. This is not civilization.
		Emily
Sit on my… ?
(beat)
I told you we needed to keep the lawn service. Can you at least pull the mower into the garage before you die? And I need you to get the kids’ lunch ready. I have a million errands to run--I can’t do everything, Derek.
She stalks into the house and Derek leans back in his chair and throws his Gatorade container across the garage.

INT. Emily’s Car - Day
Emily is sitting in the grocery store parking lot looking at a list. She talks to herself while checking off the list.
					EMILY (VO)

Meat-based food for MOM and DAD for Wednesday night, check. Cakes ordered, check. Snacks for the spawn, check. 6 bottles of fizzy wine, 2 handles of vodka, 2 bottles of single malt, 2 handles of bourbon, 4 red, 4 white, 4 cases of beer. Flavored stuff for pretty drinks. Check. Woohoo! Milk, check. Dog food. Check. Fuck. Forgot the cat food. Bank, check. Shoes for the twins, check. Florist. No check.
	(Pause)
I hate florists.
She pulls out of her parking spot and turns up the radio and heads down a cute main road full of cafes, shops with brightly colored awnings, palm trees in giant planters, and people in expensive workout clothes walking or jogging along the sidewalks.
She sees a parking spot and pulls in. The storefront before her is vacant with a sign saying “Coming Soon: Tiffy’s Puffy Paws Doggie Salon.”
					EMILY
				(out loud)
Fucking puffy paws? Puffy paws. Stupid little rat dogs.
She exits the car and heads across the street to a florist. Before she enters, her eye is caught by a giant green glass vase in the storefront next to the florist. She eyes it for a while.
SUB 5 Years Earlier
INT. Hotel Lobby Bar NYC – Night (5 years earlier)
Paul and Emily sit straight-backed, side-by-side, on a leather couch across from ED and NORMAN who sit comfortably on the overstuffed leather chairs, legs crossed, drinks in hands.

		   Norman
You don’t have to sign anything tonight. Look it over, talk about it, and we can answer any questions at brunch tomorrow. Sorry to push you but we’re ready to get going on the project.
			Paul
	(Turning to Emily)
We can go over this together tonight. It looks fairly straightforward and I have time to get the law guys on it before brunch tomorrow.
	(Pause)
Okay?
Emily is silent and staring at the art deco green glass bowl on the table. Everyone turns to look at her.
Emily
Absolutely. Sorry--I’m just, um, surprised.
Norman
Are ya sure? You sound like we just told you killing a puppy was a part of the contract.
			(pause)
It’s not.
			Emily
					(Smiles)
I’m just a little wiped out. It’s been a long day. It’ll be wonderful. I look forward to working with you.
		Ed
Alrighty. It has been a long day. Normo we should let these two look at the paperwork when we’re not staring at them.
The men stand to leave and Emily and Paul follow their lead. Shaking hands all around, the men exit leaving Emily and Paul alone by the couch. An awkward silence lingers between them.
					Paul
			Fuckers left us with the tab.
They look at each other and laugh. The laughter turns slightly maniacal and they collapse into the couch together.
					Emily
			Holy Shit.
					Paul
			You don’t have any idea, hot stuff.
				(Opens folder)
			Check out this number.
					Emily
			Woah.
				(beat)
			WOAH. That’s another zero.
					Paul
And that doesn’t include the sale of the manuscript for adaptation. And this number right here
	(points)
is the check you’ll get before they leave. Minus my commission, of course.
	(Smirks at her)			
					Emily
			This is real? Yes?
					Paul
			Real as it gets.
Emily
Hmm.
(Pauses to reflect)
Champagne. I have some in my room. Join me for 1? This is as much your deal as mine, Paulie.
Emily signs the tab, staring for a few more seconds at the green bowl. The two head towards the elevator.

INT. Emily’s hotel sitting room – Night
Emily and Paul are toasting champagne flutes sitting on the loveseat of the room’s small sitting area. Emily has one leg on Paul’s lap and the two chat comfortably. Emily is holding a green bottle of champagne. She holds it up to her face, looking at Paul through the glass. He’s green.
				Emily
		So this is legit? What’s the catch, smartypants?
				Paul
It’s legit. I’ll run it by a couple of legal people tomorrow to make sure everything’s airtight. But it’s a big, fuckoff deal.
(Pause)
The catch is that everyone’s going to make a lot more money than you. But I could see it in their beady little eyes—this is a seller.
Emily
The initial payment is more than I’ve made on my first three books combined. If this goes forward…
I can quit my job. We could move. I can buy
(pause)
shoes that don’t have crayon on them.
		(pause)
How’d we get here?
Paul
	(Playing with Emily’s toes)
You wrote a book, we flew to New York, then we had dinner with two very odd men…
Emily
From that stupid cube farm of an editorial sweatshop to…This. You’re a real agent guy. All New York and everything. And now I’m making money. Real money. Well, in theory.
Paul
I’ve always said you were brilliant.
Emily
None of this would have happened without you.
The two stare at each other. The silence is awkward, but the body language is clear. Glasses set down, they move towards each other. Emily touches his face. Paul’s hands pull her to him.
Paul
Em… You know I’ve wanted this... But I want you to be sure.		
Emily
I wasn’t sure… But now…
			Paul		
		(Whispers)
Now
INT. Hotel Room Bedroom – Night
The two are in bed, silent. Under the blankets they are intertwined. Paul smiles, Emily smiles back. He kisses her neck and she moans softly.
Sub Present Day
Int. O’connor Kitchen – Evening
Derek is alone in the kitchen. He’s putting away dishes and cleaning up. Emily’s phone buzzes on the counter. He picks up and reads the first line of a text message that pops up on her lock screen. (Text from Paul) “Hey there sexy lady. Just wanted to” Derek tries to open the full message, but the phone is locked. He doesn’t know the code. His brow creases. He puts the phone down and goes back to the dishes.
Emily enters the kitchen with the babysitter JAMIE.
				Emily
The lasagna is in the oven and the salad’s in the fridge.
(Pause)
I think that’s everything.
	Jamie
Don’t worry about a thing. I’ll call if I have any questions. We’ll have a blast. Enjoy your night!
	Derek
We’d better run if we’re going to get there on time. KIDS!
All three kids run into the kitchen, clamoring for Jamie’s attention while Derek and Emily try to snag good-bye kisses.
			Emily
Alright you three. Be good. We’ll kiss you goodnight when we get home.
They rush out the door, ignored by the kids.
Int- Restaurant- Night
Tipton and his wife TIFFY are waiting in the small, crowded entranceway to a chain restaurant when Emily and Derek walk in. Tiffy is in her early-thirties, in incredible shape, and stunning. Emily looks down at her outfit, bites her lip, runs a nervous hand through her hair and smiles awkwardly.
					Tipton
				Derek! Emily! Hi guys!
The four say their hellos and position themselves into a corner.
					Tipton
We went ahead and put in for a table. Shouldn’t be much longer. This is my wife, Tiffany. Tiffany, Derek and Emily.
					Tiffany
Please, call me Tiffy! It’s so nice to finally meet you. I’ve heard so much about you from Tip and the kids.
Derek and Emily share a quick glance, both of their faces suppressing smirks.
					Emily
			Nice to meet you too, um, Tiffy.
					Derek
			Yes, a pleasure.
					Emily (VO)
TIFFY? Her name is Tiffany. People seriously named their children this? And she wants us to call her Tiffy? Voluntarily? Oh—oh—God no---oh here it comes…
The 1980s Tiffany hit “I think we’re alone now” starts playing in Emily’s head. She looks at Derek who has to turn his head and laugh, like he knows exactly what’s going on in his wife’s brain.
Int- Restaurant- Night
Emily and Derek sit across from Tipton and Tiffy. She’s laughing at something her husband said and gently stroking his arm.
					Tiffy
				15 years and you still make me laugh.
					Emily
You two have been together for 15 years? Impressive! How’d you meet?
	Tiffy
Welllll…
	(gets a sly look on her face)
	Tipton
She didn’t know I existed. I had to throw myself at her several times in a row.
	Tiffy
Awww, sweetie. That’s not true! I was just overwhelmed by your cuteness.
	Emily (VO)
Kill me. Kill me right now.
	Tipton
No, seriously. We went to high school together. We had, like, 3 classes together our senior year and she didn’t even know my name.
		Tiffy
Tipton was—is—a genius. Everything he ever said in class was super smart. He was also on the soccer team and everyone loved him.
		Emily (VO)
High School? God. I don’t even remember high school. There were lockers…
		Tipton
No way! I was a huge nerd and the only reason I played soccer was because I was too short to play anything else. I also had pimples, braces, and a kind of mullet until I was 17.
		Tiffy
Well I only saw a hot, athletic genius.
They smile at each other with genuine warmth. Derek kicks Emily under the table.
		Tipton
Tiffy, however, was always gorgeous. I’d known who she was since the 10th grade. She was in, like, every club and played tennis and sang. She was so sweet, too. But she was always surrounded by a gaggle of girls and I was way too intimidated to ever actually talk to her.
Derek’s hand reaches under the table, grabbing Emily’s thigh in an attempt to communicate his frustration with their tedious tale. Emily suppresses a grin.
	Tiffy
We got paired up in English class to work on reciting a dramatic dialogue. We were both terrible.
(She and Tipton giggle at the same time)
	Emily (VO)
An escaped kitchen knife, an exploding cherries jubilee—anything. Seriously. Kill. Me.
Under the table Derek is lightly banging his fist on Emily’s leg.
	Tipton
Long story short, after two rehearsals were kissed for the first time (it was part of the scene) and I asked her to homecoming. She said yes and--
	Tiffy
--And we’ve been inseparable ever since.
	Emily
	(Mustering sincerity)
Aww. That’s sweet! Good for you guys.
	Emily (VO)
Oh My GOD. I bet they were virgins.
	Tiffy
How did you two meet?
Derek and Emily look at each other, awkwardly. Derek clears his throat. Both nod to the other one. Finally Emily caves.
					Emily
In a bar.
(beat)
It was a huge football day and so I got suckered into going to this super cheesy sports bar in Columbus with a bunch of people from work. It was pretty awful, actually.
	Derek
Ohio State made it to the championships, it was a HUGE game.
	Emily
His face was, uh, painted.
	Derek
She looked miserable. Hot, but miserable.
	Emily
It turns out we had mutual friends, so our groups kind of merged.
	Derek
I tried to talk to her a few times, but she was very much not interested. I thought she was kind of a bitch. But again--Hot.
	Emily
He would start talking like a normal person, but then something would happen with the game and he’d scream. It was like trying to have a conversation with someone with terrible Tourette’s. Sorry if that sounds offensive—
	Tipton
No—I’ve seen him watch a game. I understand.
Emily smiles and Derek smirks.
					Emily
So you understand. There I am, way too sober with this giant sweaty guy screaming right next to my ear with facepaint running everywhere—it wasn’t exactly candlelight and roses. He also smelled like fried food.
	Derek
Not fair. The bar smelled like fried food. I just kind of, absorbed it.
	Emily
To be honest, I have no idea how it happened, but by the end of the game he was kissing me and I was laughing and kissing this ridiculous man back.
	Derek
I’m a natural charmer. What can I say?
	Emily
We dated kind of off and on for a few months, then we realized we were exclusive and things just kind of spiraled on from there. We moved in together, we bought a couch. He proposed.
Tiffy and Tipton look at each other, unsure how to react.
					Tiffy
Well, it sounds like it was meant to be. How long have you been married?
		Derek
Almost 9 years.
(Pause)
Right, Em?
		Emily
	(Obviously doing math in her head)
Ye-es. Nate is 7 so… yes. Almost 9 years.
Int-O’connor Subaru-Night
Derek is driving, Emily is fiddling with the cd player. They’re both yawning.
					Emily
				Did you have fun?
					Derek
				Did you?
					Emily
The food was good. I haven’t had a decent dinner roll in a while.
	Derek
(laughs)
Yep. The dinner rolls were fucking unbelievable.
(pause)
OH MY GOD they are boring human beings.
	Emily
I KNOW! Seriously. They’re very sweet. But I wanted to just, I dunno, stab myself with my fork so we could leave for the ER or something. Sweet baby Jesus. I know we need some friends but-
	Derek
I don’t think they swear.
	Emily
Definitely a bad sign.
	Derek
And they’ve been together since high school? I bet they were virgins.
	Emily
That’s exactly what I was thinking! Are we bad people?
	Derek
Yes.
	Emily
Fair enough. They’re perfectly pleasant, they’re active in the community. They’re, what, good people?
	Derek
Maybe we just didn’t drink enough.
	Emily
True. But did you see her eyes when we suggested ordering a bottle of wine? It was like we suggested Jager bombs or something.
	Derek
That was fantastic. And she was trying so hard to be tactful about it—like we were—
	Emily
--like we didn’t understand how much wine comes in bottle. Waaaay too much for four adults, apparently. I bet their kids are never going to come over to play again.
(Pause)
She’s sweet, though, right? And not everyone likes wine, I guess. Maybe she does hard drugs. There’s always hope, huh?
(Pause)
I just never would have imagined him married to someone like that.
	Derek
You just think he’s hot. You like him in those coach shorts he wears at Nate’s games.
	Emily
Shut up. I do not.
(Smirks)
But maybe we should get you a pair, babe.
	Derek
You join the Junior League, I’ll get some shorts like that. Maybe even a whistle.
(Wiggles eyebrows)
	Emily
Deal.
Emily pulls out her phone and plays with it for a couple of minutes.
					Derek
Oh—why the hell did you invite them to your parents’ party? Where did that come from?			
					Emily
I panicked. They probably won’t come, don’t worry.
(Pause)
Got something for you, D. Get ready.
She’s pushes play on her phone and “I think we’re alone now” blares out the speakers. Derek laughs. Both of them start singing along, loudly.

INT. O’Connor Living Room-Later that Night
The TV is on while Derek works on putting a dresser together and Emily sits checking her email on the couch.
She opens an email from Paul. She hears his voice as she reads.
				Paul (V.O.)
Hey sweet woman. I know you’re prepping for party central. Just a quick note to say I’m about halfway through the latest masterpiece. I like it already. But it’s so different from your other stuff--a little gory. Kind of angry. It works though.
Everything okay? Should I dig into your psyche or do you just need to get away for a bit longer with a certain man of distinguished age and talented hands? ;)
Go party plan and be a super daughter. I miss you—one night is never enough. I’m plotting a way to get you up here to see me. Purely business, of course. Naked business. (Oh admit it. You laughed).
I’m off to Oklahoma this weekend. Amy’s dad had another stroke and it doesn’t look good. So I’m off to do the dutiful husband stuff. She’s a disaster. If you don’t here from me for a few days, that’s why. I’ll be thinking of you, though. Don’t forget that.
Love you. P

Emily smiles, hits “delete” and then moves down to the floor to help Derek with the dresser.
DEREK:
			Tell me again why we’re doing this?		
EMILY:
Because there’s no dresser in the guest room.
	DEREK:
	(in monotone)
You are fucking hilarious.
Gently rolls an empty beer bottle in Emily’s direction. She gets up, goes to the refrigerator, and grabs two more. She sits back down and hands him a beer while she opens hers.
				EMILY:
For my parents. We’re doing this for my parents.
DEREK:
Your parents dislike me. Your dad hates everyone. He doesn’t want to be here.
	EMILY:
He doesn’t hate everyone. And no, he probably doesn’t want to be here, but it’s what civilized people do for their parents on their 50th anniversary. Family party. Normal. An expensive, pain in the ass, normal thing to do.
	DEREK:
Why us?
	EMILY:
Well, my sister is a lunatic that lives in a house with two other families and her own two psychotic children, so her house is out. That leaves us. And we’re finally in a town we both like with good weather, good jobs, and friends that know us just enough to like us. I want my family to see this.
	DEREK:
Why do we want these people descending on our home? I’m still pissed your sister stole my pen.		
	EMILY:
You’re being ridiculous. MARIANNE didn’t steal your fucking pen! Why do you keep talking about that anyway? One of our kids probably took it.
In the middle of this Derek’s attempt to stand up the frame of the dresser result in its complete collapse. He kicks it.
DEREK:
No. If one of our kids took it, I would have stepped on it by now, gotten an infection from the ink, and ruined our floor.
EMILY:
Hmmm. You’re right. I’ll lock up the pens before she gets here, okay?
	DEREK:
It was weighted perfectly. I loved that pen.
	EMILY:
It’s time to let it go.
	DEREK:
You owe me. Big time. Like blowjobs AND uninterrupted Saturday football.
	EMILY:
Way to be a team player.
	DEREK:
They’re you’re crazy ass relatives. I don’t invite mine here.
	EMILY:
(getting irritated)
And THAT’s healthy. Cutting out your family completely?
	DEREK:
It’s certainly made my life easier.
Looks down at the directions and speaks without looking up.
Hand me piece H-17, please.
(pause)
The long screw with the flat bottom.
	EMILY:
Heee heee. Long screw. 	
DEREK:
(Smiles and shakes head)
You’re a child.
Derek leans forward and awkwardly makes his way towards Emily, grabbing her right breast and kissing her. The two lie back, falling on the spread-out dresser directions and tools. “Ows” and “oofs” are heard as they begin to undress, kissing each other between exclamations. They laugh.

Int-O’Connor Kitchen-Morning
Derek is watching TV in the family room while Emily makes pancakes in the kitchen. She checks her phone and smiles as she reads a text until screams erupt from the twins’ room. Seeing that Derek hasn’t moved away from the TV, she heads into to investigate the latest crisis. Before she leaves her phone rings and she picks it up.

				Emily
			(Shouting over the screaming)
			HELLO?

				Jane:
			Hi Sweetie! Is this a bad time?

				Emily:
			No more than normal. Hi mom. What’s up?

				Jane:
			Well… I hate to add to your stress…
Emily rolls her eyes.
INT-O’Connor Kitchen Table- Morning
The whole family is around the table. The kids are picking at their plates and there’s a lull in the noise.
				Emily:
			So, you want the latest James family drama?

				Derek:
			Not really. Nope.
				Emily
My parents have to bring Marianne and the kids with them Thursday, so the whole family will be here a day earlier.
	Derek
What’s her crisis now?
	Emily
Something about her car. I don’t f—
(looks at the kids)
freaking know.
	Derek
Why are you mad? It’s an extra day of sibling buffer for you.
	Emily
I just wanted one nice night with my parents before everyone got here.
	Derek
It would’ve just given Jane a chance to criticize you more closely and your Dad a chance to ignore you. Be glad, sweetie.
				Freya
			Am I done yet?
				Emily
			Drink the rest of your milk.
All three kids automatically down their milk and look at her.
				Emily
			Now what?
			Freya, Molly, and Nate
(in unison)
			May I be excused?
				Derek
Take your stuff into the kitchen and then you can go play.
The kids scramble from the table and Emily snags each one for a kiss.
Derek’s head is turned towards the TV, he’s obviously quit listening. Emily stands up and heads outside. The house has a porch with a screened in pool. There’s a deck adjacent to the porch. Between the house and a sea wall is a scraggly lawn with a few flower beds and room for the kids to play. The sea wall is about 6 feet above the sand of a narrow Gulf beach. A small dock juts out from the water near the stairs leading to the O’Connor yard.
As she sits down on the deck, her phone buzzes. It’s a text from Paul that reads: “just thinking of you. Have a good day. I’m boarding my flight to the middle of nowhere. Love.” Emily sighs. Hits delete and stares out at the darkening coastline.
Ext-O’Conner Deck-Morning
Derek heads out onto the deck dressed in khakis and a polo. He sits down next to Emily on the edge of his seat, prepared to bolt.
				Derek
Hey—I’ve got to run into work for a little while.
	Emily
What? Why? It’s a holiday. And you said you’d help out here with the kids.
	Derek
I know, I know. But it’s just for a couple of hours. The final version of those blue prints go out tomorrow for the building in Tallahassee and I want to make sure everything’s in order. It really shouldn’t take too long.
Emily is silent, purses her lips, and shrugs.
				Emily
				(tense)
			Okay. Just do what you have to do.
				Derek
Don’t be that way—I can’t just take this week off to amuse your family. I have a real job, Emily.
	Emily
A “real job”? What’s that supposed to mean?
	Derek
I just mean—
	Emily
What do you think I do, exactly, that paid for this house? This move? God you’re an ass some times.
	Derek
Don’t worry. I haven’t forgotten that it’s your precious book money that got us here to sweat-ville. I just mean I have to put on regular pants and go to a regular building and work with regular jackwads 5 days a week.
	Emily
You’re an architect, Derek, not a fucking factory worker. It’s not like you have to clock in. You do creative work too.
	Derek
I don’t have time to argue about this again. I’ll be back in a couple of hours.

Ext-O’Connor Dock- Midday
Emily is sitting at the edge of the dock, feet dangling over the water. The sky is light, but there are clouds in the distance and the water is choppy, clear indicators that the storm is on its way.

Sub 2 Years Earlier
Paul and Emily sit on the steps of his office building in New York watching the foot traffic. Emily is sitting, shoulders stooped, obviously upset.
				Paul
Em. Look. You can change everything if you want to. You do get to decide how you’re going to live your life. It’s not a carved in stone dictum that you have to stay.
	Emily
It kind of is, in a way. I can’t just…There’s too much at stake.
	Paul
You know I’ll never—
	Emily
	(cuts him off)
Of course I do, jackass. That’s not what I’m saying. Why would you even think that?
	Paul
Don’t snap at me. I’m trying to help.
	Emily
	(contrite)
Sorry. I know.
	Paul
Look. If you’re not going to leave, you need to change the way you think about stuff.
Look at that piece of glass, right there. On that step. What do you see?
	Emily
I don’t know. Validation for never wearing flip flops in the city? A need for an inoculation?
	Paul
Know what I see?
	Emily
A Jameson bottle?
	Paul
No. I see the night you first, uh, considered me. You picked up that champagne bottle and studied my face through it. It was weird. And adorable. You see tetanus, I see the night I fell in love with you.
	Emily
Hmnph.
	Paul
(puts an arm around her and kisses her head)
You’ve gotta get a grip, either way, Em. You can’t go on like this.
Int-O’Connor Family Room-Early Evening
Derek walks in from the office, carrying a briefcase and a large portfolio. He drops everything into the kitchen counter. All three kids are on the couch watching TV like zombies.
				Derek
			Hey guys. (no response) HEY!
				All 3 Kids
			Hi Daddy.
				Derek
			Where’s your mom?
				Nate
On the dock. She’s on the phone. She said she’d be right back in.
Ext-O’Connor Deck-Evening
Derek watches Emily’s back as she sits on the dock. He’s staring at her, his face inscrutable.
				Derek
Fuck. FUCK. I… don’t want to know. I just don’t want to fucking know.
He turns around and heads inside.

Ext. CostCo Parking Lot- Day
It’s a hot, muggy mid-October day. Emily and Derek are loading boxes and bags into the back of their Subaru. Derek steps back to close the door and is nearly run over by a large, silver sedan pulling out from the space behind them. It’s obvious the driver didn’t look and continues backing up towards Derek, who is now screaming obscenities and gesticulating wildly. When the driver still doesn’t notice and starts to pull away, Derek reaches into the car, pulls out a watermelon, and throws it, full force, at the car as it drives away. It lands with a splat in the middle of the parking lot. Emily, watching the entire thing, just blinks.
Int. O’Connor Subaru- Day
Derek is driving and Emily is looking out the passenger side window. Both of them seem tense. The radio is on. Emily reaches over and turns it down.
					Emily
				What the fuck, Derek?
					Derek
				What?				
Emily
What?! We went to Costco. We bought groceries. And when we got back to the car you lost your shit completely.
	Derek
I did not. Stop being so…so…you.
	Emily
What’s that supposed to mean?
	Derek
Melodramatic and hyper-analytical.
	Emily
Wow. You had that response ready.
	Derek
Seriously. So I yelled at some old people and stomped around a bit. I didn’t “lose my shit.”
	Emily
You threw our watermelon at the back of their Buick.
	(Pause)
We needed that watermelon.
	Derek
Fuck the watermelon, Emily. Fuck Buick-driving, dementia-ridden old people that drive like lunatics in parking lots. What if the kids had been there? What if they’d gotten hit? People here just don’t even look—
	Emily
	(Cuts him off)
What is it, Derek?
Derek looks over at her. His annoyance slips away and he begins to look guilty. He leans his head back against the headrest and sighs.
				Derek
It’s nothing. I’m sorry. I’m just frustrated—getting ready for your family, getting the house ready for the storm…
		Emily (VO)
Uuuuugh. Not again with the bitching.
		Emily
	(Sighing)
Okay. I understand, I guess. JANE’s going to be pissed about the watermelon though. I’m going to blame you.

Sub 1 year ago
Int-Hotel Room-Night
Paul is sitting up in bed, leaning back against the headboard. Emily’s head is on her chest. He strokes her hair as she traces his collarbone. She’s wearing a notable necklace of silver with a green glass pendant.
				Paul
			What’s your giant brain thinking about?
				Emily
			I’m not angry.
				Paul
Good. No one should be angry after the noises you just made. Except maybe the people in the next room.

	Emily
(smiles)
True. But I mean in general. Right now. This weekend. I’m not angry. Or tired. Or unhappy.
	Paul
Mmmnm. That’s the point, isn’t it? I don’t think this would work if that wasn’t the case.
	(pause)
I’m happy too. You know that, right? So. Very. Happy.
He kisses the top of her head and his hands slide around her. He closes his eyes and leans back. She exhales and stares off towards the door.

Ext-O’Connor House- Day
Derek and Emily are still sitting in silence after the Costco incident and as they pull into the driveway, a mini van pulls in behind them.
					Derek
				(sternly)
			They’re early, Emily.
					Emily
			Of course they are.
The mini van stops and out pile Emily’s parents JANE and JOHN, her sister Marianne, and Marianne’s two teenagers JACK and ELIZABETH. Chaos ensues: greetings, hugs, the dogs get loose, the kids are fighting over who gets to hug who first, all the while Emily and Derek are trying to say their hellos and unload the car at the same time.
Int. O’Connor kitchen –Day
Derek and John are watching TV with the older kids in the family room. Squeals from off screen suggest the twins are fighting or playing in their room. Jane and her mother are working on food preparation for the party in the kitchen. Marianne is at the table on her phone. Jane is chopping vegetables and continues what has obviously been a long monologue aimed in Emily’s direction
		Jane
…So then I just said “John, we have to buy a new car. This one just isn’t big enough for the grandkids anymore.” And he said something about none of y’all ever visiting enough to make it worth it and, as you can see, we’re still stuck in that old van. When are you guys coming down again? Anyway,
(voice fades out)
		Emily (VO)
Poor Jane. We’ve failed her. She tried her best. My mother was raised in the South (with a capital S, South) and attempted to raise her daughters as genteel ladies, doing her best to raise us to easily fit about 3 income brackets and two social classes above our comfortably normal upper-class reality.
Jane is bustling around the kitchen under foot as Emily tries to work. She opens the oven, scrunches her face in disapproval and closes it again. Emily rolls her eyes.
We went to cotillion. I own two Emily Post books. I know how to polish silver and, should the need arise, I’m fairly certain I could use all the correct utensils at a Presidential dinner.
As Emily mixes some dough, Jane eyes her work, then notices her fingernails. She touches Emily’s fingers, interrupting her voice over with the suggestion of a manicure before the party.
In addition to her dreams of pearl-wearing, white-glove owning daughters came dreams of young women with flocks of children attending their Father’s Baptist church service every Sunday. So yeah… We pretty much destroyed our mother. I didn’t do it on purpose. The training just didn’t take. I married a Midwesterner. I’m a vegetarian. I gave birth naturally, for godsake. I also don’t hug people I didn’t give birth to or sleep with. I find the practice repulsive. My sister married a guy from Puerto Rico who went to jail two months after their second kid was born. I don’t think I need to add anymore to that. I will give mom this, though. She hasn’t given up on us. She still tries when she can.
		Jane
Emily Dalton James O’Connor. What, do tell, is THIS?
She holds a carton of freshly cut fruit in the air like she just found a kilo of cocaine in the refrigerator.
					Emily
			Fruit. Lots of it. Healthy. Delicious.
					Jane
We do not serve grocery store fruit at parties. Where is my watermelon and where is your melon baller?
		Emily
Derek threw our watermelon at a Buick. What’s a melon baller?
		Jane
You are not funny, missy. Marianne!
		Marianne
Mmm?
		Jane
Take the van and go buy a watermelon, a cantaloupe, a honey dew, and some fresh oranges. And a melon baller.
		Marianne
What’s a melon baller?
		Emily
I think it’s a really pimped out melon.
Both sisters laugh and continue to discuss what a pimped out melon would actually look like. Jane smirks but feigns anger.
					Jane
You both know damn well what a melon baller is. Go, Marianne. And DEREK?
		Derek
	(from couch)
Yes, Darling Jane?
		Jane
Why did you throw our watermelon at a Buick?
		Derek
Oh. Sorry Jane. It’s an Ohio thing. You know how we are up there.
		Jane
Emily, your husband is a smartass. Now get crackin’ on those pastrami rolls. And don’t whine to me about your vegetarian bullshit. Old people like them. And this is a party for old people. Now roll.
		Emily
Okay, okay. I roll.
(Pause)
Do you think a lot of people will cancel for Saturday because of the storm?
			Jane
A category 1? No sweetie. We’re from the South. That’s just a little storm. It’ll be fine. We may lose the ones flying in, but it’ll be okay. Besides, it’ll be less crowded in here if a few people don’t show. Your family room looks a little, uh, tight with that new couch.
			Emily
		(genuinely upset)
You don’t like our couch? But it’s Ethan Allen! I thought you’d approve.
			Jane
It’s just a little big for the room, honey. But it’ll be fine. Don’t you worry. We have enough to do without you fretting.
Emily hears a noise and looks out the kitchen window in time to see a delivery truck pull up to the front of their house.
					Emily
Oh crap! Derek! The guys are here with the chairs and the tables and stuff. Can you go out there?
	Derek
Crapnuggets. I totally forgot. Where should we put all that? There’s no room in here and the porch isn’t ready.
	Emily
Just put it in the garage. Put the linens in the dining room.
(Turns to Jane and whispers)
If they hadn’t been sitting on their asses watching that…
	Jane
I know, sweetie. I know. I’ve lived with it for 50 years.
Ext- O’Connor Porch –Day
Derek and John are looking around the pool deck and porch, scanning the sky at the same time. Derek looks focused. John looks mildly amused.
					Derek
So what do you think, John? 5 tables gonna fit out here?
	John
Well, Derek.
(Pause)
I know we’ve made light of this little storm on its way, but buddy, you do know how fast the winds get during a Category 1, right?
	Derek
Not, no, um, not really.
	John
Usually around 75-95 miles an hour. Not sustained, mind, but frequent enough. And the rain tends to be, uh, a bit, heavy.
	Derek
So you don’t think the porch is a good idea?
	John
No, son. This is screen. Not the best at wind or rain protection. I know the porch is covered and all, but one good gust could easily launch those little folding chairs into the living room like missiles.
(Pause)
I’d prefer if none of my friends are decapitated during this party. Some of them are veterans.
	Derek
Well, fuck.
(Pause)
‘Scuse me, John.
	John
No, no. Fuck is right. Now I’d be happy to offer some tips, if you’re interested—
	Derek
Yes, yes. Looks like I need a little more schoolin’ in hurricane prep. Damn.
	John
Alright then. First, anything that can be launched needs to be put away or tied down. Plants, patio furniture, you get the idea. Get the kids out here to help. Oh—not the twins, though. I love them, but I think they pose a greater risk of injury than old Winston out there.
John, Derek, and the three older kids get busy moving everything inside and into the garage. The house is a disaster as they work.
INT-Emily’s home office-Day
Emily is sitting on the floor of her office wrapping presents. Outside there’s the noise of chaos as Derek, John, and the kids work on storm proofing the deck and porch. Decorations for the upcoming party are scattered around her. Her phone is on her desk, next to her open laptop. The phone rings, and she knocks the coffee over onto her keyboard reaching for it. Simultaneously panicking, looking around for towels or napkins, she takes off both her socks and starts clearing up her mess with them, swearing liberally before she answers the call. The phone screen says ALLIE.
					Emily
			Fuck.
		(Tries to blot coffee off her computer)
 Hello?
					Allie
			Emily?
					Emily
				(smiling)
			Hey Al. What’s up?
					Allie
Em…uh…I’m not sure how to say this…
		(Stifled sob)
I got a call this morning from Amy, Paul’s wife. They flew to Oklahoma a few nights ago to be with her family and Paul wasn’t feeling well. He
		(full on sob)
he had a heart attack Em. He died.
Emily
Wait—Allie you mean Amy’s Dad died. He just had a stroke-
			Allie
Oh Emmie. No. I’m so sorry. It’s Paul. It was Paul. I know you two were close. He was such a good man…And
			(sobbing)
God. I don’t understand. But I thought you’d want to know.
			Emily
		(Choking on her sobs)
Thanks for telling me Allie. I should go.
			Allie
I’ll keep you posted on the details.
Emily sobs, dropping her phone and sliding down to her knees.

INT-O’connor living room- Day
Derek, John, and the kids enter loudly from the porch to find Emily red-eyed on the couch. Not moving. Just staring. She doesn’t turn her head.
				Derek
Em? Em?? What’s wrong? Kids, go to your rooms for a little bit.
John heads off to find Jane. Derek walks over to the couch and sits beside his wife.
				Derek
			Honey—Emily? What’s wrong? Talk to me.
				Emily
			(Slowly. Breathing to avoid a sob)
Um, Allie—my friend from EdCo--called me today. Paul died. Last night. He had a heart attack.
		Derek
	(Blows out a breath)
Geez Em. I’m sorry honey. I’m so sorry. I know you two were close. He was only, what, 55? 56?
		Emily
Yeah. It was out of nowhere, apparently. He just died.
		(beat)
He’s just gone, Derek.
		Derek
Oh sweetheart. I’m sorry. It-it’ll be okay. Come here.
Bringing her into an embrace, Emily cries silently over his shoulder. Derek’s face is hard to read, expressing anger and concern at the same time.

Ext. Deck -Sunset
Emily and her father sit looking out at the water, beers in hand. Inside the TV blares and Jane’s voice carries over it.
				John
			I’m deaf. And she’s still loud.
				Emily
That she is. I think it’s happening to me, too.
	John
What’s that?
	Emily
I’m loud now. Mom voice. It comes out. I can’t help it.

John
You’re a woman. It’s what happens. Get used to it.
	Emily
Hmn.
	(Pause)
Sorry about the storm Dad.
		John
Why are you sorry? Not your fault.
		Emily
I know. I’d just wanted all your friends to be together for you guys.
		John
Well. It happens.
(Pause)
I’m sorry about your friend, baby. Losing people, well, it’s never okay.
		Emily
Thank you. And thanks for being here. I know you didn’t want to come.
		John
Don’t be stupid. ‘Course I wanted to come. See my grandbabies. See my girls.
You’re a good one, Em. Thanks for trying.
Beers clink. Silence follows.
					Emily
			Dad?
					John
			Mmm
					Emily
			How did you two stay married for 50 years?
					John
Well
(Long Pause)
Compromise I guess. General respect. Saint-like patience.
(Pause)
To be honest, I’m not surprised we’re still married. I’m more surprised I’m still alive.
No idea how I lived this long. Figured your mother woulda killed me by now. Or maimed me horribly.
		Emily
So not war, working with power tools, 2 kids, or some crazy lunatic? Mom?
		John
Yep.
		Emily
Funny. I thought you’d kill her. Or one of us.

John
Hmpf. Couldn’t kill your mom. She’d just keep coming back. And trust me, the two of you are lucky to be alive. Still don’t know how either of you made it past 30.
					Emily
Gee thanks.
		John
Oh don’t take that tone. You’re not as bad as your sister. But you did set my garage on fire.
		Emily
	   (Loudly)
That was an accident!
		John
Don’t care. Lost my golf clubs and my left eyebrow.
		Emily
Seriously, that wasn’t—
		John
	(Cuts her off)
I’m over it. But really, you can be a pain in the ass. Don’t be thinking you weren’t on the hit list several times.
		(thinking)
Your sister though…Jesus. Where did I go wrong? I tried my best. But she’s just fucked her entire life away and I have to watch it. And watch your mother try to keep the pieces together.
		(turns and looks at Emily)
And you. Well, you’re okay. Derek’s an ass. But it could be worse, I reckon. I like your kids. Twins are out of control, though. I’d tell you to beat ‘em more, but I don’t think you could catch ‘em. Fast little buggers…
		(chuckles)
			Emily
		(thoughtfully)
Are you happy Dad? I mean, now. With your life?
			John
Happy? What the hell is everyone’s obsession with that shit? Happy. (scoffs) I’m alive. I’m relatively healthy. I gave you kids and your mother a good life. No one’s in jail. I’m retired. I play golf. No one bothers me anymore, except your mother. But that’s just inevitable. Like death. And taxes. And the Bucs fucking up their season.
			Emily
I—


John
You got everything you need, more than you deserve. We all do. Happy comes and goes. That’s the way things are. Expecting to be happy all the time? That’s why you lot are all on so many goddamn pills. You live. Have a family. Hope your boat don’t sink. You die. You get to be happy sometimes. Some people never get that.
Emily’s eyes are watering. She chokes it back and drinks her beer.
					John
Ain’t nothin’ wrong with you. And thank you   for the party. It means a lot to your mom. And I like cake.
Emily laughs. Looks at her dad and back out at the water.
					Emily
I’m glad you’re here Dad. And we got you two cakes.
The two smile, not looking at each other. John stands up and moves to head inside when the childproof lock on the door keeps him out.
				John
				Emily?
				Emily
				Right here.
				John
Why is everything in your house so goddam difficult to get in and out of? There’s a lock on everything. Even the toilet. That’s just cruel.
	Emily
Derek baby proofed. I think he erred on the side of caution.
	John
Sweetie, there aren’t any more babies in he house. And if you can’t teach your three-year-olds not to drown themselves in the toilet, then you have more problems than I can help you with.


Ext-O’Connor Deck-Night
Marianne is texting frantically on her phone, mumbling to herself. Emily is sitting next to her, sipping a whiskey. Her face is tense.
				Marianne
(looking up)
			So. You’ve been extra bitchy. What’s your
problem now?
	Emily
Asshole.
	Marianne
Seriously, Emmer. What’s going on with you?
	Emily
Well, Mom and Dad’s party that I’ve been planning for 6 months is getting shafted by a tropical storm, Derek’s being a dick, the kids are making me nuts, and all you’ve done since you got here is sit on your ass and play with your phone like a goddamn 16-year-old.
	Marianne
Always the martyr.
	(pauses to text)
And I’m on my phone because I’m trying to get my car back from Eddie and figure out how who’s taking care of the kids next week.
Emily takes a large drink. Tears spill down her face and she chokes back a sob.
					Emily
				Paul died last night.
					Marianne
				Paul your agent?
					Emily
				Yeah.
					Marianne
				(Still looking down at her phone)
				Can’t you just get a new one?
					Emily
				What?!
					Marianne
A new agent. Aren’t you a big   successful writer now? Surely Emily the Great can score another agent.
					Emily
					(shocked)
				He was my friend, Marianne. A very,
very close friend. I loved him. I’ve
known him since I was 24. And now he’s gone.

Marianne
    (Genuinely)
Oh. I’m sorry Em. I forgot you two were so close, really I did. That really sucks. It never gets any easier does it, death? And people just keep…dying.
Emily is crying in earnest again, trying to hide her face behind her rocks glass. Her shoulders are shaking.
					Marianne
				Hey, hey---Em. Um, here.
				(Awkwardly hugs her)
You want to go for a walk with me? We’ll hide from Jane and I’ll let you cry. And I can finally smoke.
		Emily
	(sort of smiles)
Yeah, okay. Share a smoke?
		Marianne
Sinner.
The two head down to the beach in the dark.

Ext. Beach- Night
Emily and Marianne sit next to each other, drinking and sharing a joint. Emily is still crying, but has calmed down. The moon lights the waves and the water churns, obviously affected by the coming storm. Emily offers her bottle to Marianne.
					Marianne
					(takes a long swig)
What the hell is this? It’s like EVIL IN MY MOUTH! Jeezus.
					Emily
That, my dear sister, is Fireball whiskey. Also known as a side effect of living in the Midwest for too long.
(Pause)
				Thank you, by the way.				
					Marianne
				For what? The weed? Least I could do.
					Emily
				I know.
				(beat)
Kidding. Thanks for being here.
					Marianne
				You’re welcome, sweet. Really.
.			Feelin’ any better? You look like shit.
					Emily
			Yeah. Good as I can expect.
					Marianne
					(thoughtfully)
I know the party falling apart is a pain and losing a friend is hard, but something seems genuinely wrong with you. And not your typical OCD, general stick-up-your-assness. You seem… depressed or something. Is it Derek again?
		Emily
No. Derek’s the same. Things are fine, I guess.
		Marianne
You want my latest tragic, “oh Marianne you’re such a fuck up story?” Cheer you up?
		Emily
Always, baby sister. Always.		
Marianne
			Jack isn’t Eddie’s son.
					Emily
				(chokes on drink)
			Um, what?
					Marianne
Jack isn’t Eddie’s. He’s Rob Michaelson’s.

Emily
Ewwwww—our orthodontist’s?
		Marianne
His son, dumbass. Robbie.
		Emily
	(Unfazed)
Oh. Makes more sense. He was hot. But, um, why is this coming out of your mouth now? Jack is 16.
		Marianne
I ran into Robbie last weekend. I had Jacky with me. They’re identical. You should’ve seen Robbie’s face.
	(pause)
We met up later and I told him the whole story. But now he wants into Jack’s life. Like I could just let that happen. The whole situation is fucked.
		Emily
Can we back up 16 years, please? You got pregnant with Eddie’s kid your senior year. You didn’t go to college and married a 24-year-old mechanic/drug dealer.

Marianne
Yeah. That’s not exactly what happened.
		Emily
No shit.
		Marianne
Well, senior year, Eddie and I were fighting. I went to a party at Robbie’s house. It was his birthday, I think. Anyway, we’d always been friendly. Somehow it came up that he was a virgin. And I was like—wait. You’re leaving for your uber-nerd college in like two weeks and you’ve never been laid? I was shocked. Then, one thing led to another…
			Emily
That’s my sister. Generous de-flowerer of hot nerds.
			Marianne
Are you going to listen or not?
			Emily
		(trying not to laugh)
Sorry. Go.
			Marianne
Anyway, it was just the once. But I got pregnant. And yes, I know for sure it was his.
			Emily
Did you tell him?
			Marianne
No!
			Emily
Why? He was a sweet guy. He would’ve—
			Marianne
That’s exactly why I didn’t tell him. He had this amazing future at his fingertips. I was failing three classes and had no interest in college or anything at that point. Just Eddie, really. So, I just kind of let everyone assume it was Eddie’s.
			Emily
Jesus, Marianne. All this time?
			Marianne
Yeah.
(Long Pause)
What does it really matter, though? Eddie really is a good guy. He’s a wonderful father. And as soon as he found out about Jack, he quit dealing. He was totally straight until I got pregnant with Elizabeth. And then, well, I wasn’t working and we knew how expensive babies could be. So he thought he’d do a few deals and set us up with some funds. That’s when he got busted. It was a clusterfuck. And everyone just assumed he was a scumbag.
		Emily
I had no idea. I don’t know—
		Marianne
Bah. I let it happen, Em. We worked through it, I got a job, and after he got home things were mostly great. But we just fell apart. He’s still a good dad and we’re still basically friends.
		Emily
Can I ask you something?
		Marianne
Shoot.
		Emily
Why do you live in the crazy commune? We all just assume it’s some kind of flop house or something.
		Marianne
I come from a family of judgmental assholes.
		Emily
Pretty much.
		Marianne
		(irritated)
Why is it when women live in groups we’re either whores or witches? What is it when men live together?
		Emily
Dangerous. And usually dirty.
		Marianne
I live with JANNA and DEE and THEIR KIDS because together we can afford the rent on a big house with a pool in the best school district in the county. The kids go to some of the best public schools in the state. And they live in a safe neighborhood with good neighbors and good influences.
		Emily
I didn’t even think… Wow. That’s actually really smart. You’re a good mom, Mar.
		Marianne
Well. I’m getting there.
		Emily
Any other shockers?
		Marianne
		(smiles slyly)
I’m dating a doctor. And I’m a 2 semesters away from getting a nursing degree.
		Emily
Holy crap, dude! That’s wonderful. Do mom and dad know?
		Marianne
No one knows. I wanted to keep it a secret in case I fucked it up, as is my M.O.
		Emily
Wow. I—wow. That’s amazing. And a doctor? Do tell.
		Marianne
He works in the same complex I do. I met him through one of the other receptionists. He’s cute. Divorced. My age. Has a daughter that’s Nate’s age.
		Emily
What kind of doctor?
		Marianne
	(Mumbles)
He’s an, um, ob/gyn.
		Emily
OH MY GOD. Oh please, please tell me what THAT’s like. I’ve always wondered. I figured they’d know a little more about what’s going on down there… Or does it make the sex weird? Oh—no—he doesn’t, like, talk his way through it does he? “You’re going to feel my hand… a little pressure…”
	(collapses back laughing)
		Marianne
	(laughing but chucking sand at her)
You are a child. And no, he doesn’t talk, thank god—don’t think I wasn’t concerned about that—and he had to be trained just like the rest of them.
They laugh for a while and finally calm down to a comfortable silence.
Marianne
What’s going on with you? Really?
		Emily
	(A long Pause)
I loved Paulie, Mar. A lot.
		Marianne
	(Looks at her sister)
Wait. Like, really? Like you two were—
		Emily
--Just. Yes. Okay? We were.
		Marianne
		(Shocked)
Fuck! No way. But you don’t—you’re the good daughter. Oh my god.
(Long Pause)
How long? When?
		Emily
About 5 years.
		Marianne
Woah! That’s not, like, an indiscretion Em. That’s a big fat Other Life thing. What the hell? Who ARE you?
		Emily
I don’t know, M.
		Marianne
Um, are the girls—
		Emily
	(offended)
Christ Marianne. The girls are Derek’s. I’m not… Well, I don’t know what I am, actually. Paulie and I took a break when D and I were trying and all of that. God.
		Marianne
		(still stunned)
Oh my GAWD. This is just—what the hell?! I mean, I can understand, right, Derek’s difficult and kids are really hard and I guess everyone’s thought about it. But you? I never--
		(smirks)
Was it the sex? Or like a thrill thing or something? Ohmygod please don’t tell me anything gross.
		Emily
Nothing gross. Jesus.
(smiles)
The sex was good. But it was more the, I dunno. Intimacy? We were happy. He thought I was smart and beautiful. He touched me like he was actually looking at me. Like I was really there.

Stares off into the distance. Has clearly forgotten she’s actually talking to someone.
A couple of minutes of silence pass. Emily drinks. Marianne is thinking and staring at her sister with shock.		

Marianne
You have everything, Emily. A successful career, kids, a husband, nice house, dogs.
(Pause)
Does Derek know?
		Emily
Oh hell no. He’d light the house on fire and take the kids.
		Marianne
Man. I really thought you had everything sorted out.
		Emily
		(quietly)
I did.
(Long Pause)
But now… I don’t think I know anything, Marianne.
		Marianne
I don’t know what to say, Em. I think you just broke part of my understanding of reality.
(Pause)
But I’m really, really sorry he’s gone.
	Emily
Thanks.
Ext O’Connor Porch- Morning
Emily, John, and Jane are sitting at the table, drinking coffee and chatting while the kids swim in the pool. The sky is threatening and the wind is moving in, but the storm hasn’t hit yet.
					Emily
Good to let them get their little demons out before we’re trapped inside. And thanks, Dad, for helping us get hunkered down.
	John
What can I say? I’m an expert.
	Jane
You think we’re ready for tonight? I’ve gotten a few calls that people are settling in to the hotel.
	Emily
I think so. Are you guys excited? It’s a big deal. 50 years.
	Jane
Of course we are baby! It’s so sweet for you to do this. We’ll have fun. Despite the forthcoming weather apocalypse.
	Emily
Oh do you really think—
	John
She’s winding you up, kid. The storm is not going to be that bad. And yes we’re excited.
(sarcastically)
You know how much I love a party.
	Jane
Don’t be an ass, John.
	Emily
It’ll be fun. Ish. I promise. And again, Dad. Cake.
	John
I love cake.
(Pause)
Hey sweetie?
	Emily
Yeah?
	John
As baby-proof obsessed as Derek is, how does he deal with the kids being on the Gulf like this?
	Emily
Well, he struggles.
	Emily (VO)
And bitches and complains. And says he’ll build a fence but sits on his lazy ass instead.
	Emily (con’t)
He wants to put a fence in, we just haven’t gotten to it. We let the kids play down there, but to swim we head down closer to the public beach. The currents get pretty stiff here for some reason.
	Jane
You don’t swim out there, do you baby? I know you tend to—
	John
--do stupid shit like that.
	Jane
John!
	Emily
I do swim out there, but Derek makes me wear a life vest. He wants to tether me to the dock too… But I’m careful. I grew up with this remember?
	John
Barely. Just be careful. And for once I agree with Mr Safety’s idea. A tether might not be a bad idea.
		Emily
I’d look like a special person. Or a puppy. Not going to happen.
		John
Okay, smartass. Please don’t drown.
		Jane
Enough. John, can you watch the kids? Emily and I have work to do.
		Emily (VO)
AWESOME funtime with mom. Here we go party, here we go… Where’s my fucking sister?
Ext O’Connor House Backyard- Night
The storm has hit. There are whitecaps crashing on the shore, trees bending in the wind, and rain whipping strongly. It’s darker than it would normally be at 6:00, but it shows off the lights of the party going full swing inside.
Int O’Connor Family Room- Night
The party is on. People laugh and talk and drink and eat, the kids dart in and out and about 30-40 people seem to be having a good time under Happy Anniversary Banners and amongst photos of John and Jane and their life together.
Emily stands between the kitchen and family room, observing the party, fighting to keep a calm face. Tiffy and Tipton, who did show up, appear to be fitting in nicely. Tiffy walks up to Emily, startling her.
				Tiffy
			Oh! Sorry Emily! Didn’t mean to scare you.
				Emily
			(sniffs)
			Oh—no. Sorry. I was a million miles away.
				Tiffy
Derek told us about your friend. I’m so sorry. How you holding up?
	Emily
Oh I’m hanging in there. It’s good to be busy.
	Tiffy
Well this is a lovely party. It was very sweet of you to do this for your mom and dad. They seem to be having fun.
	Emily
They do, don’t they? I wasn’t sure how my dad would be. He’s not a party guy.
	Tiffy
He really does look happy. And there’s so many of their friends here! That’s so wonderful.
	Emily
(genuinely)
Thank you all for coming. I’m glad you made it.
	Tiffy
Our pleasure. The kids are happy and it’s better than being trapped at home in this weather.
	Emily
So, I saw you’re opening a doggie salon? Unless there’re two Tiffys in town?
	Tiffy
(laughing)
Oh no, just the one! That is mine. I thought it was time to do a little something just for me. The kids are getting so big and Tipton’s pretty engaged in other stuff… I think everyone needs a little something that’s just theirs. Mine just happens to be a doggie salon.
(pause)
That’s weird, isn’t it?
	Emily
No! I think it’s great. Good for you.
	Tiffy
(smiles genuinely)
You’re sweet. Thank you. I just love those stupid little rat dogs so much! I know it’s silly, but they make me laugh.
(whispers conspiratorially)
And people will pay out the nose to put bows on their little rat heads!
She walks away to talk to one of her kids and Emily’s left to contemplate Tiffy’s comments. She’s still fighting tears but smiles slightly. She sneaks off to her office when she sees she’s alone.
Int –Emily’s Office- Night
Emily walks in and switches a dim lamp on. She lifts up a picture of a large group of people at an office party. A much younger Paul and Emily laugh among the group. She smiles. She then picks up a photo of the two of them smiling, holding one of her books between them. As she places the photo down she picks up her phone, scanning for texts. She can’t find any from Paul. She then opens her email looking for messages from him. She realizes she’s deleted them all.
				Emily
Oh Paulie. I’m so sorry. I never said good bye.
She’s wiping tears away and putting down her phone when Derek sticks his head in the door.
				Derek
			There you are. You okay?
				Emily
			(sniffs)
			No. Not really.
Derek walks over and hugs her.
				Derek
			Missing Paul?
				Emily
			Yeah. I’m missing the funeral.
				Derek
I figured. I’m sorry. I’m sure he’d understand.
(pause)
Your sister’s looking for you. I think its cake time.
Emily nods and Derek heads to the party. She picks up their latest photo once more and touches Paul’s face. She runs her hands over her face, checks herself in the mirror and heads to back to the party.
Ext-O’Connor House- Night
The storm is raging. The lights from the O’Connor house light up the beach and images of laughing, smiling party-goers are a stark contrast against the weather outside. This makes it easy to see John and Jane opening presents and sharing a kiss, blowing candles out on a cake, and embracing the friends and family around them.

Ext- O’Connor Beach-Early Morning
Derek walks out onto the deck in a robe with a cup of coffee. He says Emily’s name, he’s obviously been looking for her. He looks out on the beach that is now marked with several “Caution: Rip Tide” signs. Beyond them he sees Emily, swimming in the dangerous water. His face becomes confused at first, then angry.

				Derek
			Why does she do stupid shit?
She turns around, waves, and keeps swimming. Derek turns around and walks inside.

Cut to black.

The End.
